1. Project Title / Headline

HR Analytics Dashboard: Absenteeism Trends, Cost Impact, and Employee Insights
An interactive Power BI dashboard designed to track absenteeism patterns, analyze employee categories, and measure cost implications—helping HR teams and business leaders improve workforce productivity and well-being.

2. Short Description / Purpose

The Absenteeism Report provides a comprehensive analysis of workforce absence patterns, highlighting total hours lost, cost implications, and trends by employee categories. It enables HR leaders, managers, and executives to identify high-impact drivers of absenteeism, track time-based fluctuations, and design targeted strategies to reduce absenteeism while maintaining employee health and engagement.

3. Tech Stack

The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:

📊 Power BI Desktop – Main platform for interactive dashboard building and visualization

🔄 Power Query (M) – Data extraction, cleaning, and transformation

🧠 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Measures for absenteeism hours, averages, and cost impact calculations

🧩 Data Modeling – Structured relationships between employee demographics, absence reasons, and time trends

🗄 SQL Server / Relational Database – For querying employee absence records before importing into Power BI

💻 SQL (SELECT, GROUP BY, Aggregations) – To prepare absence hours, cost values, and category-level summaries

📁 File Format – .pbix (Power BI project) with exported visuals for presentations

4. Data Source

Source: Employee absenteeism dataset

The dataset includes:

Total Employees and Total Hours Absent

Absenteeism Reasons (medical, preventive care, injury, unknown, etc.)

Employee Categories (education level, dependents, compensation level, commute distance)

Time Trends (absenteeism by month, by weekday)

Cost Impact of absenteeism hours

5. Features / Highlights
• Business Problem

Organizations face significant productivity and financial loss due to absenteeism. HR leaders need to pinpoint which factors (e.g., commute, dependents, compensation) and which time periods drive the highest absence rates.

• Goal of the Dashboard

To empower HR teams with:

A consolidated view of absenteeism hours, cost impact, and average absence per employee

Insights into which employee categories experience higher absenteeism

Trends across months and weekdays to anticipate peaks

Root cause analysis by absenteeism reasons

6. Walkthrough of Key Visuals

Top KPIs Panel
Displays Total Employees (740), Total Hours Absent (5,124), Total Cost Impact (202K), and Average Hours Absent (6.92).

Employee & Categories (Bar Charts)
Breaks down absenteeism by Education, Dependents, Compensation, and Commute—revealing that employees with long commutes and mid-level compensation have the highest absence hours.

Trends & Time (Line Charts)

By Month: Peaks in August and April suggest seasonal absenteeism.

By Day of Week: Mondays show the highest absence rates, dropping significantly toward Thursday.

Reasons & Comparisons (Table + Bar Chart)
Absenteeism reasons quantified by hours and cost impact. Medical/Health Conditions account for the largest share of hours and cost, followed by Preventive Care.

7. Business Impact & Insights

📉 High Cost Impact: Absenteeism cost is estimated at $202K, mostly driven by medical conditions.
📊 Category Drivers: Long commutes and mid-level compensation groups are strongly associated with higher absenteeism.
🗓 Time Trends: Monday absenteeism spikes suggest potential morale, workload, or health recovery issues after weekends.
💡 Strategic Opportunity: Preventive health programs, flexible work policies (e.g., remote days for long commuters), and wellness initiatives could significantly reduce absenteeism and associated costs.
🎯 Actionable Impact: The dashboard equips HR leaders to address absenteeism drivers directly, improving productivity and reducing financial loss.)
